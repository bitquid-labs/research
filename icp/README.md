## Canisters

Canisters are ICP's version of smart contracts. Canisters are implemented as WebAssembly modules. This allows for maximum interoperability, as developers can write canisters in a variety of languages that target WebAssembly.

- Bifinity EVM allows Ethereum developers to deploy smart contracts for bicoin written in solidity. [Docs](https://docs.bitfinity.network/)

## Chain Key Technology

### Chain Key Cryptography

Chain Key Cryptography is a Treshold Signature Scheme implementation that allows subnets with ICP to jointly hold cryptographic keys to prevents any single node from having full control over the private key, enhancing security. Even if some nodes are compromised, they cannot individually create a valid signature unless the threshold of honest nodes is reached.

### Chain Key Signatures

Chain Key Signatures allows for direct interoperability with other blockchains by allowing canisters to generate threshold ECDSA signatures which is the most commonly used signature scheme used on other blockchains (including Bitcoin and Ethereum). A rough overview of how this may work in a cross chain protocol is:

- **Assigning a subnet to our Canister**

When we deploy our canister it gets assigned to a subnet.

- **Generating the Key**

Use a distributed key generator to generate keys which would be managed by the subnet(a group of nodes) responsible for handling your canisterâ€™s requests. We can use [ICPs/ DFINITY's DKG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/339).

- **Signing Cross Chain Txs**

When your canister needs to interact with a smart contract on another blockchain (like Ethereum), it sends a request for signature to the nodes in the subnet which then uses threshold ECDSA to generate a valid signature, which can be used to sign a transaction or message intended for the other blockchain. This signature can be verified on the other chain just like any other standard cryptographic signature.
